# Conquering-Resposive-Layout
We know responsive layout it can be a pain to understand but I didn't know that HTML is already responsive but when we add some CSS we can break the responsive.

So I accidentally push my final project to this repo and I didn't know you will override it and huh, I'm glad that I have the other projects in my pc.
Anyway I FINISH this challenge! Woohoo. Man flexbox can do magic, I can't imagine if I practice grid. _sigh_ Welp time to make my *portfolio website*.
